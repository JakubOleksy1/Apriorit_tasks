Write a program in which 2 counter objects connected by signal-slot: changing the value of one will change the value of the other. Counter interface:
class Counter {
public:
    Counter(int startValue);
    int Increment();
    int Decrement();

// ... declare signals and slots

private:
    int m_count;
}

It is required to show an expamle of counters usage:
- Create two counters with a different starting value
- Execute Increment() of the first counter
- Display values of both counters
- Execute Increment() of the second counter
- Display values of both counters
- Execute Decrement() of the first counter
- Display values of both counters
- Execute Decrement() of the second counter
- Display values of both counters

Attach code files and the screen of results of execution to the report.

GUI is not required, it is sufficient to show the results in std::out.
